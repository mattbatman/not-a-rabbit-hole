tweet-text: <p>This is a must watch video. Here is a voter who explains he realized that Donald Trump was not racist when he actually debunked for himself the fine people hoax and he goes ahead and debunks it for you, but not just the full clip of what Donald Trump said. He goes further back in time and clips interview upon interview showing just how deceitful the media is.</p>
