You don&#39;t even know what Ritalin is,&quot; directed at Lauer, were dismissed as the eccentric views of a Hollywood star influenced by his religious beliefs. </p><p>However, nearly two decades later, many of Cruise&#39;s concerns have found their way into mainstream healthcare debates. </p><p>Cruise&#39;s critique of overprescription, his skepticism about the chemical imbalance theory of mental health, and his call for more research into psychiatric practices are now echoed by respected healthcare professionals and policymakers. </p><p>While his delivery was controversial, the core of Cruise&#39;s message â€“ advocating for caution and education regarding psychoactive medications â€“ has gained significant traction in contemporary healthcare discussions. </p><p>This shift in perspective highlights the evolving nature of medical understanding and the importance of questioning established practices, even when those questions come from unexpected sources. </p><p>Source: Today Show Interview 2005 Media: <a href="https://x.com/BrettRSmith76">@BrettRSmith76</a></p>'
